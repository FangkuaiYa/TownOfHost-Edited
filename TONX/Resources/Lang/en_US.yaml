FireWorksInfoLong: "(Impostors):\nFireworker can place firework bombs to cause area damage. The Fireworker can plant up to three firework bombs using shapeshift. When only the Fireworker is left among the imporstor team players and the firework bombs is placed, the Fireworker can use shapeshift to detonate the bomb. The firework bombs can also kill the Fireworker himself. But if the firework bombs kills all surviving players, it is also considered a victory for the imporstors."

VampireInfoLong: "(Impostors):\nThe bitten target of the Vampire will not die immediately, but will die suddenly after a delay. If a meeting is called within this time, the target will die immediately. If you bite a Bait, you make a normal kill and you're forced to self-report."
WarlockInfoLong: "(Impostors):\nThe Warlock can curse another players while not Shapeshifted.\nWhen they Shapeshift after cursing, the player closest to the cursed player is killed no matter how far away they are.\nWhile Shapeshifting, you can perform normal kills.\nOnly 1 player can be cursed at a time."
ZombieInfoLong: "(Impostors):\nZombie has a short kill cooldown, but moves very slowly and has very little vision. Zombie will not be voted out by anyone other than the Dictator, and the movement speed of Zombie will gradually slow down as they make kills or time passes."

HackerInfoLong: "(Impostors):\nThe Hacker can use shapeshift to hack into the shapeshifting target. The hacked target will immediately report the body killed by the Hacker in this round. If there is no dead body, the target will report its own dead body (the effect is similar to Paranoid). Note: hacking ignores whether a body can be reported. Also, hacking Lazy Guy won't do things for you, hacking Lazy Guy just wastes your time."
MinerInfoLong: "(Impostors):\nMiner can shapeshift to teleport back to the last vent they were in."

If the witch is not ejected or killed by the end of the meeting, all players that have been spelled die when the meeting ends."
MafiaInfoLong: "(Impostors):\nMafia can't kill while there are other Impostors alive in the game, but can use command /rv [player id] after death to kill the specified player."
PuppeteerInfoLong: "(Impostors):\nThe player controlled by the Puppeteer will kill the next non-impostor player that shows up closest to them. If the latter dies on contact, the former dies. Puppeteers cannot kill normally. Note that Lazy Guy will not do things for you, controlling Lazy Guy will only waste your time."

SniperInfoLong: "(Impostors):\nYou can shoot players from far away.\nYou have to shapeshift twice to make a successful snipe.\nImagine an arrow pointing from your first shapeshift location towards your unshift location.\nThat will be the direction in which the snipe will be made.\nThe snipe kills the first person in its path.\nYou cannot kill normally until you use up all of your ammos."
EvilTrackerInfoLong: "(Impostors):\nThe Evil Tracker can track other people, and the tracker can shapeshift into someone to switch the tracking target to the shapeshift target (You will immediately unshift after performing shapeshift). The arrow below the Evil Tracker's name indicates the direction of the target. When the Evil Tracker's teammate kills, the Evil Tracker will see a kill-flash."

If it is correct, the target dies, and if it is wrong, the Evil Guesser dies.\nThe guessing command is: /bt [player id] [role]\nYou can see the player's id before the player's name, or use the /id command to view the id of all players."
AntiAdminerInfoLong: "(Impostors):\nThe Anti Adminer can at any time find out if there are crewmates or neutrals near Cameras, Admin Table, Vitals, DoorLog and/or other devices. Note: Anti Adminer does not know for sure if the player is using the device while near it, they only know that someone is near the device."
SansInfoLong: "(Impostors):\nThe Arrogance reduces their kill cooldown with each successful kill of theirs."
BomberInfoLong: "(Impostors):\nThe Bomber can use the shapeshift button to self-explode, killing players within a certain range. But as a price, the Bomber will also die. Note: All players will see a kill-flash when the Bomber explodes."
ScavengerInfoLong: "(Impostors):\nScavenger kills do not leave dead bodies behind. In addition, if the victim is a bait, no self-report will be made."
BoobyTrapInfoLong: "(Impostors):\nThe Booby Trap will put a booby trap on the victim's body after killing, and the player who reports the dead body with the booby trap will be killed immediately (the body doesn't get reported), and the player who is killed will also have the effect of booby traps, and so on.

CapitalismInfoLong: "(Impostors):\nCapitalists can add a short task to a player by pressing the kill button. Note: using this ability on players who have no tasks or have completed tasks will not take effect."
GangsterInfoLong: "(Impostors):\nThe Gangster can attempt to recruit a player to a Madmate by pressing the kill button. If the recruitment is successful, both the Gangster and the target will see the shield animation on each other as a reminder (only visible to each other).

CleanerInfoLong: "(Impostors):\nCleaner can press the Report button to clean up any dead body they come across (including those they kill). If the cleanup is successful, the Cleaner will see a shield-animation on his body as a reminder (only visible to himself). The cleaned up body cannot be reported (including bait's)."
BallLightningInfoLong: "(Impostors):\nThe Lightning cannot do regular kills. After the Lightning uses their kill button on the target, the target will vaporize into a quantum ghost after a set time, and everyone can see the 「■」 next to the name of the quantum ghost as a reminder. If there is non-spherical lightning and a player who is not a quantum ghost touches the quantum ghost, the quantum ghost will be quantized immediately and die. If the quantum ghost survives until a meeting, they will die after the meeting ends. During this time, any active interaction (kill button) with the quantum ghost has no effect. According to the host's settings, killing the Lightning may cause the killer to vaporize into a quantum ghost."

At the beginning of each meeting, the Quick Shooter can only keep a certain number of bullets (the number is set by the host)."

OverKillerInfoLong: "(Impostors):\nButcher kills (including passive kills) have multiple dead bodies on targets, making it impossible to accurately identify other dead body when reporting. Note: Due to the principle of implementation, the killed target has to repeatedly display the animation of being killed. This animation cannot be skipped and cannot participate in the meeting normally during this period. In addition, if the Butcher kills the Avenger, the Avenger will revenges everyone in anger."
HangmanInfoLong: "(Impostors):\nThe killing method of the Hangman during the shapeshifting is strangling. Strangling ignores any status of the target, such as the shield of the Medic, the protection of the Bodyguard, the skills of the Super Star, etc. The strangled player will not leave a dead body, nor will it trigger any of its skills For example, Veteran kill back, Luckey stay alive, etc. (including additional roles), in addition, Seer will not be prompted."
